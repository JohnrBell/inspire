# Project One

**Build a web-based, CRUD application.**

## Objectives

1. Build confidence as a developer from building something of your own.
-  Manage yourself (your time and your emotions) when given a large amount of unstructured work.
-  Gain experience building a complex application.
-  Document your work and share it with the public in an effective and articulate manner.
-  Learn new technologies by reading documentation.

## Dates

* *Start* - Morning of Thursday, December 18.
* *End* - 12:30PM on Tuesday, January 6

At 1:30pm on 1/6/15, we will present to our classmates the progress we have made.

We recommend you budget three full days over the break to working on your project.

## Process

Just like we've been practicing in class:

1. Create a Trello board with `Backlog`, `Doing`, and `Done` lists.
- Collect user stories from the spec of your choice and enter them into the `Backlog` list.
- Write an ERD
  * attach this to your ERD card in Trello
- Wireframes - detail the flow of your app through simple wireframes
  * attach these to Trello cards
- Routes - design the HTTP route architecture of your app
- Iterative Development
  * Move one story at a time into the `Doing` list. Once it's done, move it to `Done` and start your next story.
  * **DO NOT** try to work on more than one or two stories at once.

## Deliverables

- Public repo on Github with your project code
- `README.md` (in the root folder of your project) that includes:
  - The project's name and description,
  - APIs or Gems used and descriptions of each,
  - Instructions for downloading the code and running it on localhost
  - Link to the Trello board you used to manage your stories
  - Link to the live url of your hosted project...
- Deployed the application to a Digital Ocean droplet

## Instructors

As this project is mostly self-driven we expect you to spend a lot of time debugging errors and problem solving on your own. That said, we want to schedule 1:1 with each of you to review your progress and give feedback. 

Each student will have one 45 minute pair programming session with an instructor. Please [sign up for a slot](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/spreadsheets/d/1glJJhkOZ8p8Jg40HN45zFpN36wXffjrobRvdwjt04GM/edit#gid=0).

Please keep in mind that we will not be maintaining a help queue or giving assistance if you grab us outside of your scheduled time. 

Additionally, we will be conducting a review session on Thursday morning for anyone who wants to go over databases and ActiveRecord.

## Keep in Mind

**You are going to encounter a ton of unexpected errors and problems.**

Expect to come up against a lot of what can *seem* like roadblocks. Resist the urge to get frustrated. These are amazing learning opportunities. A lot of students treat errors during projects as just getting in the way of "finishing". The point of this project is **not** to finish all of the user stories; the point is to integrate your knowledge and deepen your understanding of how to put apps together.

Errors often provide the most valuable source of information about what we don't yet understand. Seeing an error as "it's not working" and randomly changing stuff until "it works" won't teach you anything. Spending time thoughtfully debugging issues is a fantastic investment that will lead to greater mastery and understanding.

## Feature Sets

#### [Team Microblog][microblog]

A microblog allows users to create, read, update, and destroy miniature blog posts. A team microblog allows a group of users to create posts on a shared feed. These posts can reference outside links, scrape useful information from them, and add novel commentary to the linked content.

#### [Forum][forum]

A forum is an application that allows users to both post information and to comment on other's posts, or tag the other posts with metadata. One of the most important functions of forums is to allow "voting" on content to determine it's popularity.

#### [Wiki][wiki]

A wiki is an application that allows users to create and modify content collaboratively. In a wiki application, the history of a document and changes to it are an important part of what they are. Wikis can chart and connect content from a variety of sources, and the interaction of users working on them.
